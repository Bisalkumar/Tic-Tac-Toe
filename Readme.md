# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the `tkinter` library in Python.

## Features

- Play Tic Tac Toe with two players, represented by the symbols 'X' and 'O'.
- Players can enter their names before starting the game.
- Specify the number of games to play together, and the winner is determined by the player with the most wins.
- A "Play Again" feature is available after each game ends.

## How to Play

Players take turns to place their symbol on the grid by clicking the available cells.
The goal is to be the first to complete a row, column, or diagonal with your symbol.
After each game, the scores are displayed, and a winner is declared based on the most wins in the series.
